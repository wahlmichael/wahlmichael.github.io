		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>I am a student of web development and technology in general. I possess a strong passion for learning and improving myself everyday. In the future my goal is to have a job as a web developer though I do not possess all of the necessary skills yet. I am eager to work hard and prove myself in the industry.</p>

		<p class="inner">At this intership I was tasked with creating a new intranet site for the company through wordpress. As the sole person assigned to this project, I had to teach myself this new technology and create a product that suited the various needs of the departments. Although no coding was required, I learned many valuable skills about web development and the self learning process. After the site was complete, it was my duty to communicate with the departments and teach them how to maintain their portion of the site after I was gone.</p>
